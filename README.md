# Devkeepr PHP binaries

## Building

Devkeepr uses [`static-php-cli`](https://static-php.dev) to build minimal, statically-linked, self-contained PHP
executables for each platform.

They are automatically built weekly to get the latest versions of PHP near enough as soon as they become available.

[Check here](https://github.com/devkeepr/php-bin/blob/main/php-extensions.txt) for the definitive list of
extensions that are compiled in.
